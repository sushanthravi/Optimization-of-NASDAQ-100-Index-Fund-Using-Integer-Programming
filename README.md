# Optimization-of-NASDAQ-100-Index-Fund-Using-Integer-Programming
In this project, we are constructing an **Index Fund** that tracks the **NASDAQ-100 index** using **Integer Programming (IP)**.

## Project: Optimization of NASDAQ-100 Index Fund Using Integer Programming

The goal is to select a subset of stocks from the index that can closely replicate the indexâ€™s performance, while minimizing transaction and rebalancing costs. The steps involve stock selection, portfolio weight optimization, and evaluating the tracking accuracy across different portfolio sizes.

### Key Steps:

1. **Stock Selection**:
   - We formulated an **integer programming** model to select **m stocks** from the NASDAQ-100. The selection is based on maximizing the similarity (measured by a correlation matrix) between the selected stocks and the entire index.

2. **Portfolio Weights**:
   - After selecting the stocks, we solved a **linear programming** problem to determine the optimal portfolio weights, minimizing the tracking error between the portfolio and the index returns.

3. **Portfolio Evaluation**:
   - The selected portfolio is tested on **out-of-sample data** (2024) to evaluate how closely it tracks the NASDAQ-100 index, based on the stock selections and weight optimizations from the **in-sample data** (2023).

4. **Incremental Analysis**:
   - We repeated the process for different values of **m** (e.g., 5, 10, 20, ..., 100) to assess whether increasing the number of selected stocks improves tracking accuracy or results in diminishing returns.

5. **Mixed-Integer Programming**:
   - We also explored an alternative method by solving the portfolio optimization problem directly using **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)**, constraining the number of non-zero weights to **m stocks**.

6. **Out-of-Sample Testing**:
   - The performance of the portfolio constructed from 2023 data is tested on the 2024 data, with tracking accuracy measured by comparing the index and portfolio returns over time.

7. **Final Recommendations**:
   - Based on the analysis, we provide recommendations on the optimal number of stocks for constructing an efficient index fund, balancing accuracy with cost efficiency.

### Tools and Techniques:
- **Gurobi Optimizer**: To solve the integer and linear programming models.
- **Python**: Used for implementing optimization models, data handling, and portfolio performance analysis.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of **integer programming** and **linear programming** to construct an index fund that tracks the NASDAQ-100, evaluating trade-offs between tracking accuracy and the number of selected stocks.
